  The Sun, (called Sol in Spanish), is the primary light in space that shines upon the earth.
The sun orbits in a circuit in the firmament above the earth's surface. Despite common misco-
nceptions and similarities, the sun is not a star. Because of it's luminosity, it dominates 
the sky during daylight hours. After it rises fully above the horizon no stars are visible.
  Energy from the Sun in the form of insulation from sunlight - supports almost all life on
Earth via photosynthesis and drives the Earth's climate and weather.

  Earth is one of the eight major planets in the solar system. It is ranked third in the order
of the sun and the sun. It is also the terrestrial planet with the largest diameter, mass and 
density in the solar system, 150 million kilometers away from the sun. The earth rotates from 
west to east and revolves around the sun. It is 40-46 billion years old,It has a natural sate-
llite - the moon, which forms a celestial system - the Earth-moon system. It originated from the 
original solar nebula 4.6 billion years ago.
  The Earth's equatorial radius is 6378.137 kilometers, the polar radius is 6635.725 kilometers, 
the average radius is about 6371 kilometers, and the equatorial circumference is about 40076 
kilometers. It is an irregular elliptical sphere with a slightly flattened equatorial drum. The 
earth's surface area is 510 million square kilometers, of which 71% are oceans and 29% are land. 
The earth is blue in space.
  There are nuclear, sputum and shell structures inside the earth, and there are hydrospheres, 
atmospheres and magnetic fields outside the earth. The Earth is the only celestial body known to 
exist in the universe, and is home to millions of creatures, including humans.
